### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an opensource enthusiast currently in search of my next gig. Previously I've held engineering roles most notably @ Salesforce, SumUp and Paysafe.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a secret scanning tool called [rvsecret](https://github.com/rumenvasilev/rvsecret).

## Interests
Golang, APIs, K8s, IaC, distributed systems, developer productivity tools, platform engineering

## OSS
I've contributed to a number of OSS projects over the years. Here're a few of them:

- [response code must be 204, because body has no content](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/pull/158)
- [introduce unknown license list](https://github.com/goph/licensei/pull/75)
- [fix error handling; unexport func](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/pull/100)
- [add data source alerting channel office365](https://github.com/gessnerfl/terraform-provider-instana/pull/151)
- [send audience to tokenreview api](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-kubernetes/pull/74)
- [Autodetect protocol from git address](https://github.com/git-hooks/git-hooks/pull/25)

I've also started a few OSS projects myself, but those you'd be able to find in my account. :)
